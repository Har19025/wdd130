    <h3>My name is Seth Harmon and I am a passionate 3D modeller and fabricator from Idaho. I have been studying at Brigham Young University Idaho (BYUI) online for the past four years learning skills necessary to be an excellent member of a design team. I am currently in my last year of schooling through BYUI and plan to graduate in July of 2026 with a Bachelors in Applied Technology. I have maintained a 3.94 GPA while working full time at JST Manufacturing to further develop my skills hands on and digitally. JST has allowed me to work closely with engineering drawings, personal projects for family, and learn important plastic welding practices for quality parts and results. I enjoy working hands-on with these amazing wet bench tools and love to work hard on modelling future projects for school and friends. </h3>

    <h3>My wife and I love to get outdoors and appreciate the scenic views Idaho has offered us. If it involves hikes, rock climbing, kayaking, or swimming we are on board. We try to make it a priority to experience the world since schooling and working can absorb a lot of time out of the regular routine. One of my favorite hobbies I have is a family tradition to go fishing in Westport, Washington over the Summers. Another chance to go after my “someday” trophy fish and a wonderful day out on the ocean.</h3>
