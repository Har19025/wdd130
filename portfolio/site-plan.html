      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I would like to make a website that acts as a library for my personal projects and accomplishments over the years. The first page can capture my 
        work through school and experiences with an introduction to the page. The following two pages can be a location to place real life examples of my work.
        Moreover, I can place my completed certificates through Solidworks or through BYUI. 
        I hope to use this website with my career endeavors as a quick accesibile link to help market myself to employers. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I hope that I can add this to my resume or Linkedin page as a media source. This will be accesbile by my peers at work, by recruiters, and by 
        employers. This will be a professional website made to attract people who are looking for high quality workers.

      My name is Seth Harmon and I am a passionate 3D modeller and fabricator from Idaho. I have been studying at Brigham Young University Idaho (BYUI) online for the past four years learning skills necessary to be an excellent member of a design team. I am currently in my last year of schooling through BYUI and plan to graduate in July of 2026 with a Bachelors in Applied Technology. I have maintained a 3.94 GPA while working full time at JST Manufacturing to further develop my skills hands on and digitally. JST has allowed me to work closely with engineering drawings, personal projects for family, and learn important plastic welding practices for quality parts and results. I enjoy working hands-on with these amazing wet bench tools and love to work hard on modelling future projects for school and friends. 
	
      My wife and I love to get outdoors and appreciate the scenic views Idaho has offered us. If it involves hikes, rock climbing, kayaking, or swimming we are on board. We try to make it a priority to experience the world since schooling and working can absorb a lot of time out of the regular routine. One of my favorite hobbies I have is a family tradition to go fishing in Westport, Washington over the Summers. Another chance to go after my “someday” trophy fish and a wonderful day out on the ocean.

      <h3>Completed Projects</h3>
      <p>
      These are some of the projects that I have worked on since I have started working within SolidWorks. These models and designs were carefully crafted to ensure a quality looking figurine as well as a sturdy piece of furniture in which I can appreciate both daily. 

	    This is a model of a “Ghost” from the popular game Destiny and Destiny 2. I played this game as a highschooler and it has been one of my favorite stories I had the chance to participate in. To model this design I had no blueprint to follow along and no instructions to guide me through it. I used public reference images, memory, and attention to detail to produce it through 3D printing. I want to continue to do so in the future with more complex designs or continuing to improve the current model. 

      This is the first of two shelves I have made in SolidWorks. They were customized and measured to fit a small space between my bed and wall within the models. This allowed me to have better organization and storage in my bedroom but also ensured clearance for charger cords and side walls to ensure nothing falls off the outside edge. I have made an additional shelf for my mother-in-law that has shelf stiffeners to support heavy-weights and a larger design. I have had the chance to make these myself with Plastic Welding and Fabrication. I personally cut out the pieces to size, ensured they were square, and ran strong welds for some great furniture in my home. I plan to make another piece of furniture for my dad and his office space.

      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        These are a collection of completed certificates through BYUI and through Dassault Systemes. The certificates below represent my ability to read and understand engineering drawings as well as create them. In addition to that, I can model and design them for personal or professional use. While these are certificates I would consider the most significant. I also have completed through Dassault Systemes the Certified SolidWorks Sheet Metal Professional and Weldments Professional training. I want to pursue more of these skills and use them for the rest of my life in the engineering and manufacturing fields.
