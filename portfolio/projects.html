    <p class="proj-text">These are some of the projects that I have worked on since I have started working within SolidWorks. These models and designs were carefully crafted to ensure a quality looking figurine as well as a sturdy piece of furniture in which I can appreciate both daily. This is a model of a “Ghost” from the popular game Destiny and Destiny 2. I played this game as a highschooler and it has been one of my favorite stories I had the chance to participate in. To model this design I had no blueprint to follow along and no instructions to guide me through it. I used public reference images, memory, and attention to detail to produce it through 3D printing. I want to continue to do so in the future with more complex designs or continuing to improve the current model. This is the first of two shelves I have made in SolidWorks. They were customized and measured to fit a small space between my bed and wall within the models. This allowed me to have better organization and storage in my bedroom but also ensured clearance for charger cords and side walls to ensure nothing falls off the outside edge. I have made an additional shelf for my mother-in-law that has shelf stiffeners to support heavy-weights and a larger design. I have had the chance to make these myself with Plastic Welding and Fabrication. I personally cut out the pieces to size, ensured they were square, and ran strong welds for some great furniture in my home. I plan to make another piece of furniture for my dad and his office space.</p>
