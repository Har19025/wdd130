        <p class="proj-text">These are a collection of completed certificates through BYUI and through Dassault Systemes. The certificates below represent my ability to read and understand engineering drawings as well as create them. In addition to that, I can model and design them for personal or professional use. While these are certificates I would consider the most significant, I also have completed through Dassault Systemes the Certified SolidWorks Sheet Metal Professional and Weldments Professional training. I want to pursue more of these skills and use them for the rest of my life in the engineering and manufacturing fields.</p>
