    <p>Hi I am Seth (:</p>
    <p>
    I am currently working towards a Bachelors in Applied Technology and have been studying Computer Aided Design the past year. I am married and
    we do not have any kids but we do have some stubborn animals that keep us busy. I work for JST Manufaturing as a Plastic Fabricator
    and help build some really amazing plastic machine housing that holds different programmed machines that make computer components.
    I love this job so much, it works with blueprints, designing, creativity, and more and has been  huge blessing for my family. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a little experience with web design from previous classes and my wife says she wants me to make one for her a future business down the road.
        So I figured I should learn some more to make it look nice. When I am not working or doing school I spend my time with friends, playing games,
        rock climbing, or swing dancing with my wife.
    </p>
